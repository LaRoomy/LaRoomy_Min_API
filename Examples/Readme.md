# Examples for the minimized version of the LaRoomy Api

## Description

All examples are written for the example schematic published in this repository. A Microchip atmega328p is used in conjunction with a microchip RN4871 Bluetooth Module. The RN4871 is preconfigured with the parameters given on the root page of this repository. All examples are using the sleep function and when the RN4871 module is preconfigured for auto-sleep the examples have an average power consumption of ~150ÂµA.

## Examples

### All Simple Properties
> This example uses all properties from simple type. A button, switch, level-selector, level-indicator, text display and an option-selector are added to the api.

### Time-Selector and Time-Frame-Selector
> This example demonstrates the usage of the time specific properties, including how to request the current time from the app when the device is connected. The retrieved time is saved in the Microchip MCP79410 real time clock ic which is also located on the example board.
