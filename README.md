# LaRoomy_Min_API
 This is a minimized Version of the LaRoomy Api written in C and is optimized for 8 bit microcontroller. It's not platform specific: It can be used in conjunction with all controllers which have an externally bluetooth hardware.

 To implement the API in the existing logic, the data which must be sent and the data which is received must be bypassed to the api through registering a gateway function for each direction, respectively.
